#Fitness App

<p>This app was created using React and Express.</p>
<p>It fetches exercise data from the backend API I created. The API data was originally gotten from an existing rapidAPI ("ExerciseDB").
I did'nt use exerciseDB due to its restricted number of endpoint call that can be done per month.
Since it's a personal project (Frontend/Backend), I felt it better to create a personal API where I can perform unlimited number of Endpoint calls.
